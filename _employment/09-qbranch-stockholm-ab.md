## About the Role
This was my first period at Qbranch, working as an IT consultant and system developer for both external clients and internal integration projects.

## What I Worked On
### Fullstack Developer at hitta.se
I worked as a fullstack developer at **hitta.se**, contributing to the development of their platform during a period of rapid growth and feature expansion.

### System Integration Consulting
I took on integration‑focused assignments at several organizations, including:
- Sigtuna Council
- Taxi Stockholm
- ICA Banken
- Sveriges Television (SVT)

At ICA Banken, I worked on quality assurance tasks and wrote an inventory script that collected information about their SQL Server instances.
At SVT, I handled minor maintenance tasks for their inventory system.

### Identity Management — Sigtuna Council
I was the sole developer on an identity‑management project for **Sigtuna Council**, built around **Microsoft Identity Integration Server (MIIS)**. The implementation became **Microsoft’s reference project** for MIIS, highlighting the quality and completeness of the solution.

## Reflection
This period established my early experience in system integration and fullstack development. The MIIS project at Sigtuna Council stands out as a technically demanding assignment that delivered long‑term value and earned external recognition.
