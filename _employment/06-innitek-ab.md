## About the Role
Innitek was a short‑lived IT consultancy started by the CEO of Looström & Gelin to explore opportunities in the growing software development market. I worked there as an IT consultant during its brief run.

## What I Worked On
### Document Management System for Looström & Gelin
I developed a document management system in **Visual Basic 5** for Looström & Gelin AB, supporting their internal workflows.
### Company Website
I built Innitek’s company website using **ASP**, giving the new consultancy an online presence.

## Reflection
A brief but productive period where I delivered concrete software for both Looström & Gelin and Innitek itself.
