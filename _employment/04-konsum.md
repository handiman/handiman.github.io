## About the Role
I worked as a shop assistant for Konsumentföreningen Stockholm across several stores during my late teens and early twenties.

## What I Worked On
### Store Operations
I handled day‑to‑day tasks in grocery retail, including stocking, checkout, customer service, and general store operations.
### Section Responsibility
I was responsible for the greens section at the Lidingö store and the beverages section in Nacka, ensuring that each area was stocked, organized, and ready for customers.
### Multiple Store Locations
Most of my time was spent at a store on Lidingö, with additional periods in Nacka and a shorter stint at Rådhuset in central Stockholm.
### Operational Responsibility
I was entrusted with opening and closing the stores and ensuring that the daily register totals were secured in the store’s deposits — responsibilities that required reliability and trustworthiness.

## Reflection
A long early job that helped me support myself before moving into IT. It grounded me in practical work, responsibility, and customer interaction long before my technical career began.
