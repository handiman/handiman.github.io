## About the Role
I worked as a PC technician for Lidingö Stad, supporting the municipality’s IT environment during the late 90s.

## What I Worked On
### PC Deployment and Configuration
I configured and deployed PCs in a **Novell network** running on a **Token Ring** topology.
### Help Desk Support
I handled day‑to‑day support issues for municipal staff, covering both hardware and software troubleshooting.

## Reflection
A practical early role that gave me hands‑on experience with networks, operating systems, and user support.
