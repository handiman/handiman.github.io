## About the Role
I first came to Karena as a work‑experience student in 8th grade, and they later hired me through a youth employment program after I finished 9th grade. It became my first real job — a place I enjoyed and where I built friendships that have lasted.

## What I Worked On
### Store and Register Work
I handled the checkout, helped customers, and took care of general store tasks.
### Pet Care and Daily Routines
I fed and cared for the budgies, hamsters, fish, and other small animals, and helped maintain the fish tanks and pet areas.
### Early Responsibility
Even as a teenager, I was trusted with day‑to‑day routines and tasks that kept the store running smoothly.

## Reflection
My first job, and one I loved. It taught me responsibility, customer interaction, and the satisfaction of being part of a small team — long before my later career in tech.
