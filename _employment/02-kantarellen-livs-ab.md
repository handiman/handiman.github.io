## About the Role
I worked at Kantarellen Livs on Lidingö during a period when I needed full‑time work. The store expected me to stay on longer, but I later shifted to part‑time music studies and returned to Konsum part‑time instead.

## What I Worked On
### Section Responsibility — Greens
I was responsible for the greens section, keeping it stocked, fresh, and well‑presented throughout the day.
### Store Operations
I handled general store tasks including stocking, checkout, and customer service as part of the small team.
### Operational Responsibility
I was entrusted with opening and closing the store and handling the daily register routines, responsibilities that required reliability and trust.

## Reflection
A short but steady job during a challenging period, and another early role where I was trusted with concrete responsibility.
