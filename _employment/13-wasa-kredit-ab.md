## About the Role
I worked as a lead developer at Wasa Kredit, focusing on improving code quality, development practices, and collaboration across teams.

## What I Worked On
### Reducing Complexity
I refactored key parts of the codebase to make the system easier to understand, maintain, and extend. This reduced unnecessary complexity and improved long‑term stability.

### Executable Specifications
I introduced **living documentation** through executable specifications. This made requirements unambiguous, testable, and always up to date, improving both communication and quality.

### More Collaborative, Agile Development
I helped guide the teams toward a more agile way of working, with product owners, analysts, testers, and developers collaborating throughout the entire development cycle instead of handing work off in stages.

## Reflection
This role was about making development smoother and more predictable — simplifying the codebase, clarifying requirements, and improving how teams worked together.
