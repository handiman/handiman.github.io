## About the Role
I served as a stand‑in study circle leader for Sollentuna Jazz Workshop, a community‑driven music program offering ensemble practice and jazz education.

## What I Worked On
### Ensemble Guidance
I led rehearsals and supported participants in developing their ensemble playing, timing, and improvisation skills.
### Substitute Leadership
I stepped in as a substitute for one of the regular leaders during this period, helping keep the group running smoothly.

## Reflection
A short but meaningful role connected to my music studies, and a chance to contribute to a local jazz community I was part of at the time.
