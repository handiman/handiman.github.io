## About the Role
I worked as an IT consultant and system developer at Avega, taking on assignments for several enterprise clients in Stockholm.

## What I Worked On
### Client Assignments
I delivered development and integration work for:

The assignments varied in scope and technology, but all centered on building or improving systems used in day‑to‑day operations.
