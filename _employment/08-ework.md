## About the Role
After Icon Medialab went bankrupt, eWork became the administrative employer that allowed me to continue my work for **Hewlett‑Packard Sweden** without interruption.

## What I Worked On
Web Development for Hewlett‑Packard Sweden
I worked on web development tasks for **HP Sweden**, contributing to the maintenance and evolution of their online presence during this period.

## Reflection
A long engagement with HP, routed through eWork for administrative reasons, but representing a continuous stretch of hands‑on web development work.
