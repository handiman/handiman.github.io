## About the Role
I joined Icon Medialab during the late‑90s tech boom — often referred to in the media as **“Shining Stockholm”**. Icon was one of the standout companies of that era, known for its fast pace, ambitious projects, and cross‑disciplinary teams. It was my first real step into the world of professional web development.

## What I Worked On
### Web Development for Enterprise Clients
I contributed to web development projects for:
- **Hewlett‑Packard Sweden**
- **Compaq**
- **Siemens Medical**
- **Icon Medialab**’s internal intranet

The work ranged from building new features to maintaining and improving existing systems. It was a mix of hands‑on coding, collaborating with designers and project managers, and adapting to the rapidly evolving web standards of the time.

## Reflection
A formative early period working with major clients during a fast‑moving phase of the web industry. Icon Medialab taught me how to deliver under pressure, work across disciplines, and navigate the energy and uncertainty of the dot‑com era — lessons that stayed with me long after the bubble burst.
