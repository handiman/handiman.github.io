## About the Studies
I attended Kulturama back when it operated as an independent arts education institute, taking part in two of their music programs.

## Programs
### Allmänna Musiklinjen
A broad foundational program in ensemble playing, basic theory, and practical musicianship.
### Musikerlinjen
A more advanced program where I studied arrangement, improvisation, contemporary harmony (in the Berklee tradition), and ear training, deepening both my theoretical understanding and practical skills.
### Additional Studies
Alongside the main programs, I also took part in evening classes in film music composition and traditional harmony, expanding my musical vocabulary beyond the core curriculum.

## Reflection
A focused year that strengthened my musical foundation and connected me with a community of musicians during an important period of my early adulthood.
