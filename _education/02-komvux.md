## About the Studies
I attended KomVux Lidingö to continue my upper‑secondary studies through Sweden’s municipal adult education system. During this period, the school was experimenting with new computer‑related programs, and I enrolled in one of these early tracks.

## Focus Areas
The program covered practical, hands‑on computer and technical skills including:
- setting up **Ethernet‑based networks**
- configuring networking on **Windows 3.11** PCs
- installing and configuring **PC hardware**
- manually attaching coax cable connectors and working with early network topologies
- using **Microsoft Works** and other everyday software
- writing simple **console‑based C++ programs** (the classic “add two numbers” exercises — and discovering the limits when trying to make it handle any number of inputs)
- learning **technical drawing** (pen‑and‑paper 3D sketches) as preparation for future AutoCAD work

Alongside the technical courses, I also completed a broad set of academic subjects, including:
- **Swedish A–C**
- **English A–C** (top grades throughout)
- **Mathematics A–C**
- **History A and B**
- **Philosophy**
- **Psychology**
- **French**
- **Geography**
- **Religion**
- **Studieteknik (study skills)**

These studies gave me the technical grounding that eventually led to my first IT role at Lidingö Stad, and the academic foundation I had previously missed.

## Reflection
KomVux became an important turning point. It marked the shift from my music background into the world of computers, and it opened the door to the career path I’ve followed ever since.
