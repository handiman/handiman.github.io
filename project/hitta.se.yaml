Description: >
 Was a key person in the development of hitta.se - one of Swedens top 10 most popular sites.
 Created the services hitta.se/trafiknytt (traffic information) and hitta.se/vader (weather information).
 Hitta.se is a Swedish search engine that offers telephone directory, addresses and maps.
 It has been one of Sweden's 10 most popular sites for quite some time, I worked with hitta.se's internal order system and improved the public map site with services such as weather and traffic information.
