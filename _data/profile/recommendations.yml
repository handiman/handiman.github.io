   Henrik is, without a doubt, one of the best developers I have worked with during my years in the IT and Internet business. 
   He is fast, he understands customer needs and he contribute with great ideas when he think that systems or applications can be created in a better way than originally requested. 
   Henrik is a loyal and easy going person who I enjoyed working with a lot and who I recommend any company to hire!
