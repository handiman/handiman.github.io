## Context
In 2014 I returned to Qbranch. While waiting for my next client assignment, I contributed to an ongoing internal system used to manage consultant CVs. The application had been in use for some time, and developers who were “between projects” would step in to extend and improve it. The team worked in a **Scrum** setup, and the system was hosted in **Microsoft Azure**, which gave me my first hands‑on experience with cloud‑based deployment and operations.

## Work
### Application Development
- Added and improved features for creating, editing, and organizing consultant CVs
- Implemented UI updates and interactions using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **jQuery**
- Developed backend functionality in **C#** with **Entity Framework 6**
### Engineering Practices
- Applied **test‑driven development** to keep changes safe and maintainable
- Used **continuous integration** to maintain build quality and shorten feedback loops
- Participated in the team’s **Scrum** process, contributing to planning, refinement, and iterative delivery

## Outcome
- Contributed incremental improvements to an internal tool used daily across the organization
- Gained practical experience working with Azure‑hosted applications

## Reflection
This was a short, practical internal engagement; the kind of work that fills the gaps between client projects while still offering meaningful contributions. 
It provided a balanced mix of frontend and backend development and introduced me to Azure in a hands‑on way.
