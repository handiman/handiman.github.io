## Context
During my second period at Qbranch in 2014, I joined a small team working on a legacy requisition management system for Arbetsförmedlingen, Sweden’s public employment service. This was a maintenance‑focused engagement involving older technologies and long‑standing code paths. The work was steady, structured, and primarily centered on keeping an existing system operational.

## Work
### Maintenance & Support
- Performed corrective maintenance on a large, aging codebase built with **VB.NET**, **WinForms**, **WebForms**, and **WCF**
- Updated and stabilized integrations with internal **Web Services**
- Worked with an **Oracle** backend
### Collaboration & Process
- Participated in the team’s established workflows and routines
## Outcome
- Helped maintain a critical internal system used across the organization
- Improved stability through targeted fixes and careful handling of legacy components
## Reflection
This was a straightforward maintenance assignment on a legacy stack. Not the most exciting work, but an important part of supporting large public systems that rely on long‑lived software.
