## Context
Astando (now Norconsult Astando, following acquisition by [Norconsult](https://www.norconsultastando.se/)) is one of Sweden’s leading companies in the GIS domain and a key contributor to the Local Road Database (LV) concept — the national foundation for applications related to road networks, traffic, and road‑user information.

In 2008–2009, I joined Astando as a consultant from [Avega Group AB](https://avega.se/) to contribute to the continued development of a client/server application used by Stockholm and Gothenburg for importing, processing, and presenting traffic measurement data.

## Problem
Municipal traffic departments needed a reliable way to import large volumes of traffic measurement data from various sensors and systems, normalize it, and present it in a way that supported analysis and operational decision‑making. The existing application was already in use but required ongoing development, refinement, and new capabilities.

## Approach
### Application Development
- Contributed to the continued development of a WinForms‑based client application for visualizing and working with traffic measurement data
- Extended backend components and Windows Services responsible for data import, transformation, and processing
- Implemented data access using Oracle and NHibernate
### Architecture & Engineering Practices
- Used Spring.NET for dependency injection and modularization
- Applied Test‑Driven Development to improve reliability and maintainability
- Participated in early Continuous Integration workflows to ensure stable builds and predictable delivery
### Domain Integration
- Worked with the Local Road Database (LV) model to align traffic measurement data with the national road network
- Ensured compatibility with municipal data formats and operational workflows

## Outcome
- Strengthened and extended a production system used by Stockholm and Gothenburg for traffic data import and presentation
- Improved data processing reliability through automated services and structured data handling
- Enhanced code quality and delivery consistency through TDD and CI practices

## Reflection
This engagement combined desktop application development, backend processing, and GIS‑related domain modeling. It was an early opportunity to work within an established codebase, contribute to a complex data‑driven system, and apply disciplined engineering practices — experience that later helped shape my long‑term relationship with Norconsult Astando.
