## Context
I joined hitta.se during a period of rapid growth, working across backend services, data processing, and the public‑facing map and search experience. 
At the time, hitta.se was consistently ranked among Sweden’s ten most‑visited websites, which meant performance, reliability, and fast iteration were essential.

## Work
### Public Services
- Designed and built **hitta.se/trafiknytt**, consuming traffic data from Sweden’s national road authority (**Vägverket** at the time)
- Created **hitta.se/vader**, integrating weather data from **Storm.no** into the map experience
- Improved the public map site with new features, UI refinements, and performance optimizations
### Internal Systems
- Maintained and extended hitta.se’s internal order system
- Worked across ASP.NET, C#, T‑SQL, MSMQ, XML/XSLT, and IIS
- Contributed to backend services that supported high‑traffic, data‑driven features
### Fullstack Development
- Implemented both server‑side logic and client‑side functionality using AJAX, JavaScript, XHTML, and CSS
- Collaborated closely with designers, product owners, and other developers in a fast‑moving environment

## Outcome
- Played a key role in the development of one of Sweden’s most popular websites
- Delivered new public services that expanded the functionality of the map platform
- Strengthened internal systems that supported advertising, orders, and content workflows
- Helped the team ship features quickly while maintaining stability under heavy load

## Reflection
This was one of the most formative projects of my early career. 
The combination of scale, speed, and visibility made it both challenging and deeply rewarding. 
I had the opportunity to work across the entire stack and build features used by a large portion of Sweden’s internet users.
