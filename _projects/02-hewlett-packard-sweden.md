## Context
During my time at IconMedialab (and later through eWork), I worked with Compaq on several web‑based systems for the Scandinavian and EMEA regions. When Hewlett‑Packard acquired Compaq, the work continued under the HP brand — meaning I contributed to both Compaq and HP solutions during this period.
The technology stack spanned classic ASP, VBScript, early .NET, SQL Server, XML/XSLT, and EPiServer, reflecting the transitional era of web development at the turn of the millennium.
## Work
### Event Administration (EMEA)
- Requirements analysis, use‑case design, and development of a web‑based administration interface for managing information and registrations for customer events across EMEA
- Implemented functionality in classic ASP, VBScript, and SQL Server
### Scandinavian Product Database
- Requirements analysis, design, and development of a web‑based administration interface for the Scandinavian product catalog
- Built data‑driven features using ASP, T‑SQL, and XML/XSLT
### Intranet & Web Presence
- Developed templates and components for the EPiServer‑based intranet
- Contributed to maintenance and further development of [www.hp.se][hp], including content updates, layout adjustments, and smaller functional improvements
## Outcome
- Delivered multiple internal and external web solutions used across Compaq and later HP’s Scandinavian and EMEA operations
- Helped modernize parts of HP Sweden’s web presence during a period of rapid technological change
- Built early experience with requirements work, system design, and full‑stack web development across classic ASP and early .NET
## Reflection
This project represents a formative period in my career — working across two major global brands during a time of shifting technologies and evolving web standards. It taught me how to collaborate with large organizations, translate requirements into working systems, and deliver practical solutions in an era before modern frameworks and tooling.
