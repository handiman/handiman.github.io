## Context
Looström & Gelin was a small engineering consultancy where I took on my first professional software development assignment. I joined through InniTek AB in 1998, working with Visual Basic 5, classic ASP, and COM — my introduction to real‑world software development.

## Work
- Contributed to the development of a document management system built in Visual Basic 5
- Implemented smaller features and fixes across the application
- Assisted in building and maintaining the company’s website using classic ASP
- Gained early experience with COM‑based component development and Windows‑centric tooling

## Outcome
- Delivered incremental improvements to the internal document management system
- Helped establish and maintain the company’s early web presence
- Built foundational experience in professional software development, team workflows, and shipping working code

## Reflection
This was my first step into the industry — long before I understood object‑oriented design or modern engineering practices. The code wasn’t elegant, but the experience was invaluable. It taught me how to work in a real development environment, collaborate with colleagues, and deliver software that people actually used. Everything that came later was built on this foundation.
