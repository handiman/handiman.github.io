## Context
CashGuard specialized in cash‑management solutions for the retail industry. During my assignment, I worked on StoreManager, a system used to monitor and manage CashGuard installations in stores. My primary focus was improving the development process itself by introducing behavior‑driven development practices.

## Work
### Introducing Specification by Example
- Served as the key driver in adopting behavior‑driven development (Specification by Example)
- Transformed existing Word‑based user stories into executable specifications using SpecFlow
- Established a shared language between developers, testers, and product owners by grounding requirements in concrete examples
### Automated Regression Testing & Living Documentation
- Created the initial foundation for automated regression tests
- Ensured that specifications doubled as living documentation, always in sync with the system’s actual behavior
- Demonstrated how executable specifications could reduce ambiguity and improve communication
### Application Development
- Contributed to the StoreManager codebase using C#, WCF, and ASP.NET MVC
- Worked with SQL Server for data storage and integration
- Used WiX for packaging and deployment scenarios

## Outcome
- Introduced a working BDD approach that clarified requirements and made system behavior verifiable
- Delivered executable specifications that improved test coverage and documentation quality during the assignment
- Strengthened the StoreManager platform through clearer requirements and automated verification

## Reflection
This was a short but influential engagement. Introducing Specification by Example gave me the opportunity to see how executable specifications work in practice and how they can reshape the way requirements and testing are approached. It was a rewarding chance to apply the technique in a real project and build a working foundation for automated verification.
