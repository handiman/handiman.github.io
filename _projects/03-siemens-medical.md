## Context
During my time at IconMedialab, I worked with Siemens Medical on their global intranet platform, EMPower. The system was built using classic ASP, COM components, and a mix of XML/XSLT for content rendering — typical of large enterprise intranets at the time.

## Work
- Supported the development and maintenance of the EMPower intranet
- Performed QA, testing, and verification of new features and updates
- Assisted colleagues with debugging, integration issues, and content‑related workflows
- Worked across classic ASP, VB6/COM components, JavaScript, and SQL Server
- Contributed to smaller enhancements and fixes within the intranet’s codebase

## Outcome
- Helped maintain a large, business‑critical intranet used across Siemens Medical
- Improved stability and quality through structured QA and support
- Gained experience working in a large, distributed enterprise environment with multiple teams and technologies

## Reflection
This project was part of my early professional development — a chance to work inside a sizeable corporate intranet with real users, real deadlines, and a mix of legacy and modernizing technologies. It strengthened my understanding of team workflows, QA practices, and the realities of maintaining long‑lived enterprise systems.
