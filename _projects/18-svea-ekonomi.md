## Context
[Svea Ekonomi][svea] was my first assignment as a freelancer. I joined the team responsible for **Svea Checkout**, a payment solution being rolled out across Sweden, Norway, and Finland. The work combined backend development with a strong focus on engineering practices, particularly around testing and documentation. I also took on a mentoring role, helping the team strengthen its approach to TDD and executable specifications.

## Work
### Backend Development
- Built and extended APIs using **C#** and **ASP.NET Web API**
- Applied **CQRS** patterns to separate read and write concerns
- Worked with **Entity Framework** for data access
- Contributed to deployment workflows using **Octopus Deploy**
### Engineering Practices
- Introduced and coached **test‑driven development** to improve code quality and confidence
- Rewrote existing tests as **executable specifications** to make intent clearer and behavior easier to understand
- Improved API documentation by generating most of it automatically, reducing manual effort and inconsistencies
- Helped strengthen the team’s **continuous integration** routines

## Outcome
- Contributed to the rollout of Svea Checkout across multiple Nordic markets
- Improved the clarity and maintainability of the test suite through executable specifications
- Reduced documentation drift by automating large parts of the API documentation
- Supported the team in adopting more consistent and sustainable engineering practices

## Reflection
This assignment marked the beginning of my freelance career and set the tone for how I like to work: combining hands‑on engineering with a focus on clarity, testing, and sustainable development practices. It was a chance to contribute to a real‑world payment product while helping a team level up its approach to quality.
