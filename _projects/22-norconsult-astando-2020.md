## Context
My relationship with Norconsult Astando goes back to 2008–2009, when I worked with them as a consultant from Avea Group AB. Nearly a decade later, after seeing on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prettygoodprogrammer) that I had started freelancing, they reached out and asked if I was available for a new engagement. I returned in 2018 to modernize deployment workflows, and again in 2020 to support full‑stack development and legacy modernization.

Norconsult Astando develops GIS‑driven solutions for municipalities and infrastructure organizations. The systems I worked on were primarily built on ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET Web API, and WCF services, with frontend components in JavaScript/TypeScript and KnockoutJS. Deployments were handled through TeamCity and Octopus Deploy.

## 2018 Engagement — DevOps & Backend Engineering
### Problem
The IsyRoad project suffered from slow, manual, and error‑prone deployments. Each deployment took around 45 minutes per application instance, and the process introduced frequent human‑related errors.

### Approach

#### Automation & DevOps
- Introduced automated deployment pipelines using Octopus Deploy
- Integrated TeamCity build steps with deployment workflows
- Standardized configuration and environment handling

#### Backend Development
- Contributed to ASP.NET Web API and .NET Core services
- Improved maintainability and reliability of backend components
- Worked with NHibernate and WCF‑based integrations

### Outcome
- Deployment time reduced from ~45 minutes to ~5 minutes per instance
- Deployment‑related errors reduced by nearly 100%
- A more predictable and maintainable delivery pipeline for the team



## 2020 Engagement — Fullstack Development & Legacy Modernization

### Problem
Several legacy systems required new functionality, improved readability, and better testability. Deployment automation also needed refinement to support ongoing development.

### Approach

#### Backend Development
- Implemented new features in ASP.NET Core and ASP.NET Web Forms applications
- Improved structure and clarity in existing codebases
- Enhanced testability through clearer separation of concerns
#### Frontend Development
- Delivered new UI functionality using TypeScript, JavaScript, and KnockoutJS
- Improved maintainability of legacy frontend components
#### Automation
- Extended and refined deployment automation using Octopus Deploy
- Contributed to TeamCity build pipelines
#### Outcome
- Delivered new functionality across several legacy systems
- Improved code readability and testability, reducing friction for future development
- Strengthened deployment automation for ongoing work


## Reflection
Across all three periods — 2008, 2018, and 2020 — the work combined pragmatic engineering with meaningful improvements to delivery workflows. 
The long‑standing relationship with Norconsult Astando reflects a pattern of trust built over time: solve real problems, improve the systems that matter, and make life easier for the teams who maintain them.
