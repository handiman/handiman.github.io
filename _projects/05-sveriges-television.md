## Context
During my time at QBranch, I spent a short assignment at Sveriges Television (SVT), Sweden’s national public broadcaster. The work focused on maintaining an internal inventory tool used by the organization. Although the engagement was brief, it was memorable simply because it was SVT — a unique environment compared to the corporate clients I usually worked with.

## Work
- Performed maintenance and smaller updates on SVT’s internal system inventory tool
- Worked with classic ASP, VBScript, VBA, and SQL Server
- Assisted with troubleshooting and minor improvements to support day‑to‑day operations

## Outcome
- Delivered the required maintenance within the two‑week engagement
- Ensured the inventory tool continued to function reliably for internal users
- Gained a glimpse into the operational side of a major broadcasting organization

## Reflection
This was a small assignment, but a fun one — my first and only time working inside a television company. The work itself was straightforward maintenance, but the environment made it stand out among my early consulting projects.
