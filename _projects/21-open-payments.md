Open Payments provides a PSD2-compliant platform letting FinTech, 
E-commerce businesses etc integrate with European banks through 
a single unified API - the Open Payments Platform.

Much of my focus lay on implementing automated onboarding in the client's Customer Portal - a single page React application with a .Net Core backend integrating with a Dynamics CRM and a variety of Azure resources.
