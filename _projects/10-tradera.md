---
## Context
While between client assignments at Avega Group, I joined an internal team working on a WPF‑based sales support system intended for managing articles and campaigns published on Tradera.se. Even though my time on the project was brief, it was a solid opportunity to contribute to a modern desktop application built with a contemporary tech stack.

## Work
### Application Development
- Contributed to the development of a **WPF** desktop application used for managing product listings and campaign data
- Implemented features and UI components using **C#**, **WPF**, and **WCF**
- Worked with **NHibernate** for data access
### Collaboration
- Joined an existing team and quickly became productive within a short engagement window
- Helped maintain development momentum while waiting for the next long‑term assignment

## Outcome
- Strengthened the internal product with additional functionality and refinements
- Provided Avega Group with continuity on the project during a transitional period
- Gained hands‑on experience with WPF, WCF, and NHibernate in a real production codebase

## Reflection
This was a short but valuable engagement. The kind of assignment that keeps skills sharp and exposes you to new technologies while waiting for the next long‑term client project. It also served as a smooth transition into what would become my assignment at [Länsförsäkringar][lf].
