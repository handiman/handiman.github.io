## Context
Insplanet brought me in as a senior developer during a period of transition. Their architect and lead developer had recently left, and they needed someone who could stabilize the situation, preserve critical knowledge, and keep development moving. My work focused on documentation, deployment reliability, and simplifying the team’s build and delivery processes.

## Work
### Architecture & Knowledge Preservation
- Captured and organized architectural knowledge to prevent loss during the transition
- Updated and clarified existing documentation to make the system easier to understand and maintain
### Build & Deployment Improvements
- Implemented **zero‑downtime deployment** to reduce operational friction
- Simplified the CI pipeline using **Azure DevOps** build pipelines
- Streamlined deployment workflows with **Octopus Deploy**
### Development
- Contributed to ongoing development across a mixed stack: **ASP.NET MVC**, **ASP.NET Web API**, **.NET Core**, **C#**, **jQuery**, **React**, and **TypeScript**

## Outcome
- Ensured continuity after the departure of key technical staff
- Reduced deployment risk through zero‑downtime releases
- Made the build and deployment process faster, clearer, and easier to maintain
- Left the team with better documentation and a more predictable delivery pipeline

## Reflection
This assignment was less about building new features and more about stabilizing a team in transition. It was a chance to apply senior engineering judgment, reduce operational complexity, and leave the client with a clearer, more maintainable setup than the one I walked into.
