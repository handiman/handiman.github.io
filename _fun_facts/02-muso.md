title: I've studied music
---
I used to dream of becoming a professional musician and even studied music a couple of years at Kulturama in the early 1990's.
Then I came to my senses, cut my hair and became a programmer.
Music is still an important part of my life though. I enjoy listening to music, playing my guitars now and than and composing.
