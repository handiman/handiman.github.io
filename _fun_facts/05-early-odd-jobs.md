# Early Odd Jobs
During the early–mid 1990s — a rough economic period in Sweden — I picked up a couple of part‑time jobs to make ends meet. These weren’t glamorous, but they helped pay the rent. Not quite the Monty Python [Four Yorkshiremen][monty] sketch, but close enough.

- **Stairwell cleaner** in a tenement building
- **Hotel room cleaner** at Hotel Foresta on Lidingö
