# My First Brush With Programming

In 7th grade we had something called *Fritt valt ämne*. One hour every Friday where you could pick a subject and explore it for a term. For reasons unknown, I ended up choosing programming.

We used a Swedish school computer called **Compis** and wrote tiny programs in **BASIC**. I grasped 'IF' statements and the infamous 'GOTO', but the whole thing felt abstract and slightly pointless. I remember thinking: “Who in their right mind would want to spend time doing this?”

To be fair, I was 13 and far more focused on trying to impress the girl I had a crush on than on mastering control flow
