Long before I became a developer, I developed all sorts of things that had nothing to do with computers:

- **Svart Duell:** a home‑made Drakar och Demoner role‑playing adventure me and a friend wrote as teenagers. I still have an untouched original copy. No, it’s not for sale.
- **Sinkadus contributions:** small submissions to the very first issue of the Swedish RPG magazine. 

Looking back now, I’m oddly proud of these early creations. They’re rough, for sure, but they capture a younger me who just wanted to make things.
