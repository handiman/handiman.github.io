I can help you save time and money, avoid headache and possibly even make you sleep better by automating your deployment process. 

I have several years of experience doing just that using **GitHub Actions**, **Azure Pipelines**, **Octopus Deploy** and **TeamCity**

An automated deployment process has a number of benefits:

- **It saves time**   
  First and foremost it saves time and time equals money.
- **It is reliable**   
  You can count on deployment being done exactly the same way every time. Human mistakes are eliminated.
- **It is person independent**   
  Manual deployment gets as easy as clicking a button. As releases can be scheduled or even fully automated no one even has to be present.
  
## Case Studies

### [Norconsult Astando AB][astando]

**Isy Road** had an all manual deployment process. 
The deployment documentation was spread over several documents and was not up to date. 
I helped the client setup automated deployment for Isy Road as a pilot project. **Octopus Deploy** was used and benefits included:

* Reduced deployment time from ~45 minutes to ~5 minutes per application instance - 15 at the time.
* Automated database deployment.
* More confidence in the deployment process.
* Virtually no deployment related errors.

The success of the pilot project lead to setting up automated deploy for their products **Isy Map** and **Isy Case** as well.
  
### [Plejmo][plejmo]

**Plejmo** had an all manual deployment process that was not very difficult but 
stole a lot of time from the small development team ‐ time that should be used to develop the product. 
Using Octopus Deploy we were able to: 

* Reduce deployment time from ~1 hour to ~10 minutes.
* Automate database deployment.
* Virtually eliminate deployment related errors.

The deployment process became so quick and painless that we could (and sometimes did) deploy several times a day ‐ even during peak hours.
