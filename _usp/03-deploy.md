I can help you save time and money, avoid headache and possibly even make you sleep better by automating your deployment process. 
<!--more-->
I have several years of experience doing just that using Octopus Deploy.

An automated deployment process has a number of benefits:

* #### It saves time
  First and foremost it saves time and time equals money.
* #### It is reliable
  You can count on deployment being done exactly the same way every time. Human mistakes are eliminated.
* #### It is person independent
  Deployment gets as easy as clicking a button. As releases can be scheduled no one even has to be present.
  
## Case Studies

### Norconsult Astando AB 

[Isy Road](https://www.norconsultastando.se/_/vagnat-och-trafik/ISY-Road/) had an all manual deployment process. 
The deployment documentation was spread over several documents and was not up to date. 
I helped the client setup automated deployment for Isy Road as a pilot project. Octopus Deploy was used and benefits included:

* Reduced deployment time from ~45 minutes to ~5 minutes per application instance (15 at the time of writing).
* Automated database deployment.
* More confidence in the deployment process.
* Virtually no deployment related errors.

The success of the pilot project lead to setting up automated deploy for their products [Isy Map](https://www.norconsultastando.se/_/gis-och-kartproduktion/tjanster/) and [Isy Case](https://www.norconsultastando.se/_/vagnat-och-trafik/ISY-Case/) as well.
  
### Plejmo

[Plejmo](https://www.plejmo.com) had an all manual deployment process that was not very difficult but 
stole a lot of time from the small development team - time that should be used to develop the product. 
Using Octopus Deploy we were able to: 

* Reduce deployment time from ~1 hour to ~10 minutes.
* Automate database deployment.
* Virtually eliminate deployment related errors.

The deployment process became so quick and painless that we could (and sometimes did) deploy several times a day - event during peak hours.
