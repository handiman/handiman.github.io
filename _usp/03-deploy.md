I’ve spent years helping teams automate their delivery processes using **GitHub Actions**, **Azure Pipelines**, **Octopus Deploy**, and **TeamCity**.

A reliable delivery pipeline saves time, reduces stress, and frees teams to focus on building the product instead of babysitting deployments.
<!--more-->It also brings a few practical advantages:
- **It saves time** — deployments become a non‑event instead of a time sink
- **It’s reliable** — the same steps run the same way every time
- **It’s person‑independent** — anyone can trigger a release, or it can run fully automatically

Below are two examples of how I’ve helped teams move from manual deployments to predictable, automated delivery.

### [Norconsult Astando AB][astando]

**Isy Road** had an all manual deployment process. 
The deployment documentation was spread over several documents and was not up to date. 
I helped the client setup automated deployment for Isy Road as a pilot project. **Octopus Deploy** was used and benefits included:

* Reduced deployment time from ~45 minutes to ~5 minutes per application instance - 15 at the time.
* Automated database deployment.
* More confidence in the deployment process.
* Virtually no deployment related errors.

The success of the pilot project lead to setting up automated deploy for their products **Isy Map** and **Isy Case** as well.
  
### [Plejmo][plejmo]

**Plejmo** had an all manual deployment process that was not very difficult but 
stole a lot of time from the small development team ‐ time that should be used to develop the product. 
Using **Octopus Deploy** we were able to: 

* Reduce deployment time from ~1 hour to ~10 minutes.
* Automate database deployment.
* Virtually eliminate deployment related errors.

The deployment process became so quick and painless that we could (and sometimes did) deploy several times a day ‐ even during peak hours.
