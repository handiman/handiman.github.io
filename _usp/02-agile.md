Do your tests fail intermittently? 
Is it hard to tell why a test fails? 
Would you like your tests to be more like documentation? 
 
I have extensive experience of TDD, BDD and Specification by Example. 
I can help you make your tests more readable, make them fail better or even 
rewrite them as executable specifications.
 
I'm agile for real.
