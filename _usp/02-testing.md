I’ve spent years working with TDD, BDD, and Specification by Example — not as buzzwords, but as everyday practice.

I help teams write tests that actually say something: tests that read like documentation, fail in meaningful ways, and describe behaviour instead of just asserting it.

If your test suite is slow, brittle, unreadable, or full of mysterious red failures, I can help you turn it into something you trust — or even reshape it into executable specifications that guide development instead of dragging behind it.

## Examples
I’ve created a few small demo projects to help teams understand how to write meaningful tests in practice. They’re a few years old, but the ideas still hold up:

- **[SpecFlow demo](https://github.com/handiman/specflow.demo)**: a simple example of Specification by Example and executable specifications
- **[Fail Better](https://github.com/handiman/fail-better)**: NUnit techniques for clearer, more human failure messages, including custom constraints that make XML validation errors understandable

## Case Studies

### Wasa Kredit

Several internal financial systems had accumulated years of technical debt, duplicated logic, and drifting requirements. I helped the team introduce Specification by Example and living documentation using SpecFlow, grounding discussions in concrete examples instead of abstract descriptions.
Benefits included:

- Clearer, example‑driven requirements shared by developers, testers, and analysts
- Executable specifications that doubled as documentation and automated tests
- Reduced ambiguity and safer refactoring through meaningful test coverage
- A more iterative, collaborative way of working across the whole development cycle

This created a more predictable development process and a healthier foundation for long‑term maintainability.

### CashGuard

StoreManager had drifting Word‑based requirements and no automated way to verify behavior. I introduced Specification by Example and turned existing user stories into executable specifications using SpecFlow. This created a shared language between developers, testers, and product owners and formed the basis for automated regression testing.
Benefits included:

- Clear, example‑driven requirements instead of ambiguous documents
- Automated regression tests that reflected real business behavior
- Living documentation that stayed in sync with the system
- Better communication and fewer misunderstandings across the team

This gave the team a foundation for meaningful tests and more predictable development.
