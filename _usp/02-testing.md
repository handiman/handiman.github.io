I’ve spent years working with TDD, BDD, and Specification by Example — not as buzzwords, but as everyday practice.

I help teams write tests that actually say something: tests that read like documentation, fail in meaningful ways, and describe behaviour instead of just asserting it.

If your test suite is slow, brittle, unreadable, or full of mysterious red failures, I can help you turn it into something you trust — or even reshape it into executable specifications that guide development instead of dragging behind it.
