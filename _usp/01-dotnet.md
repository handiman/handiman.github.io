I’ve worked with .NET since the very beginning. From classic .NET Framework via .NET Core to modern .NET and it’s still the ecosystem where I’m most at home.

C# is my everyday language, the one I think in, but I’ve also spent years in VB.NET when projects required it.

If you need someone who understands the platform across its entire history — the old frameworks, the new patterns, the migration paths, the pitfalls, the tooling — I can help you build, modernize, or untangle just about anything in the .NET world.
